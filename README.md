Salesforce’s Field History Tracking is one of the most valuable native features on the platform. When used correctly, it brings transparency, accountability, and traceability into business processes by clearly answering three critical questions: what changed, who changed it, and when.
However, as soon as implementations grow beyond simple use cases, the out-of-the-box solution begins to show its limitations. In regulated environments, data-heavy objects, or enterprise-scale orgs, these limitations often force teams to look for a more flexible and scalable approach.
This git outlines a custom field history tracking framework built using Custom Objects, Custom Metadata, Apex, and Lightning Web Components. The design is metadata-driven, extensible across objects, and capable of tracking field types that Salesforce does not support natively.
